The following are concepts I want to explore in my future art.

#### Take only as directed
Paintings made from years of disused and expired prescriptions, with an emphasis on mental health medicines. A special thanks to television that now prescribes these medicines to us with whimsical commercials. So ask your doctor if my paintings are right for you!

#### Yet more to worry about
Using potentially harmful materials; motor oil, gasoline, plastic resins, battery acid, epoxy and other potentially volatile chemicals in paintings. Once these pieces dry are they inert? Do they still require the same restrictions requiring their handling or (let's hope not) disposal? Warning: art not to be taken internally.

#### Techno is dead
Using near-field communication (NFC) and Bluetooth communication protocols in enabled beacons embedded within paintings to expand the meaning or use of a piece. It could be fun, it could also lead to other unforeseen issues. Speaking of...

#### Laws are boring
Archaic computing and electronics laws like ECPA, CFAA (both from 1986) are unjustly convicting the curious and ruining lives. What if I purposely infringe on these statues by putting electronic copies of copyrighted, or illegal, material in my paintings? Would this be a legal liability for myself, the artist? How about for the buyer? What if the buyer wasn't informed of the embedded data? Also, would encryption change any of those answers?
