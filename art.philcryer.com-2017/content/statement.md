I paint when I want to but never have the time or sustained interest to make it a habit. Instead of talking about what I have done with my art, I want to talk about what I want to do, new topics, groupings or themes.

It's my hope that this kind of more broad-based approach will increase my output and interest; presented here in order of viability.
