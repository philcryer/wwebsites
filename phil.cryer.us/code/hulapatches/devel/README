gethula 


DESCRIPTION
	gethula - checks out and builds current Hula codebase
		(see http://www.hula-project.com/ for information)


USAGE
	To use gethula, after unpacking, type the following:
      		cd gethula
 		vi gethula (modify variables at the top to suit your system)	
      		chmod a+x gethula

	If you already have a Hula server running, stop and backup Hula:
		cd <hula_prefix>/sbin
		./hulamanager -s (wait for all processes to stop)
		mv <hula_prefix> <hula_prefix>-old

	Run gethula:
		su - root (if required)
      		./gethula

	If you have an existing Hula server, copy over all prefs and mail into the new Hula:
		cd <hula_prefix>-old 
		cp -R mdb share var <hula_prefix>
	
	Start Hula:
		cd <hula_prefix>/sbin
		./hulamanager -d

		NOTICE: I'll be adding code to automate those backup steps, for the brave!


REQUIREMENTS
	gethula was developed and tested on FreeBSD (5.4-RELEASE, 6.0-SNAP004), but it will 
	run on any UNIX as long as you have the following installed:
		svn (client)
		expect
		additional packages that Hula requires to build


MOTIVATION
	One of the motivations for this script (besides staying up to date) was to contribute
	to the project, while ensuring that the current SVN code would run on FreeBSD, as 
	patches are required.  All needed patches are included, and are automatically applied 
	if the script is run on FreeBSD.  Of course the MAIN motivation for this was to run
	the Hula calendar and mail server.  It's the best such app available, and I see it 
	expanding very rapidly; my hope is that I (even in a small way) help towards this goal.
