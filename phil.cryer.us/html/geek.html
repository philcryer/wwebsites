		<h2>It's like 1980 all over again</h2>
		<p><img src="../images/dexter.gif" class="left" alt="Dexter"/>While it used to be a four letter word, it is now a (somewhat?) coveted title. Either that or people just have short memories. Regardless, knowing about technology and having a desire to constantly improve it is now almost as accepted as jaywalking.</p>

 		<p>I'll start at the beginning, or a least close enough to it.  I started using computers at the age of nine and started programming in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29">Logo</a> and BASIC shortly thereafter. I've been online since 1995, running a bunch of my own websites since 2001. My main dynamic sites, my weblog as it were is <a href="http://fak3r.com/">fak3r.com</a> and my news/commentary site, where I discuss digitial rights and personal privacy, <a href="http://lefttochance.com/">lefttochance.com</a>, plus other sites I've hosted and run can be found on the launch page for <a href="http://cryer.us/">cryer.us</a>, which I've maintained since 2001.</p>

		<p>After years of floundering around doing art installation, picture framing, ticket sales (for events as diverse as symphonies and rodeos), I stumbled upon tech support.  I started by providing the dreaded phone tech support, but after a stint as a technician momentium built behind me as I moved along until hitting my ideal position; Linux Administrator.</p>

		<h2>operating systems.</h2>
		<p><img src="../images/freebsd_mascot.gif" class="right" alt="FreeBSD's Beastie"/>I've run Linux since 1997 (Red Hat 5.0) and really love it.  Over the years I've become very comfortable with it, and that's part of the reason I installed <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> on my main server back in 2002.  I really love it's stability and sanity inducing configuration, it's an amazing internet server that I've used to serve up webpages, act as an email server, and tons of other things.  At home I run a simple NetGear router to provide NAT (network address translation) for the internal network, <img src="../images/tux.gif" class="left" alt="Tux"/> with another functioning as a print server.  We have many operating systems running, like <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a>, the great <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> based distribution, for our workstations, another FreeBSD server for backups, (running <a href="http://freenas.org/">FreeNAS</a>) along with a couple of OS X installations, even a Win2000 and XP machine make appearances on the network.</p>

		<h2>networking.</h2>
		<p>I've always enjoyed playing with computers, and what better way than to continually add more connected together.  Here's a a schematic of a recent layout of my <a href="../images/network.png">home network</a>.  Extended ideas are to bring a PVR component (MythTV) onto the server, and have it server not only our internal network, but run through all televisions in the house.</p>

		<h2>code.</h2>
		<p>I keep a collection of old scripts (Korn, Bash and Perl) that I have written over the years that may be useful to others.  While most of these are quite simple, they are useful enough for me to keep for reference and share.  They, like all of my coding, are all available under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC1">GNU public license</a> version 2 or later; so you may do with them what you will.  <a href="../code/">Click here</a> to take a look. I also have some more specific/bigger projects that I've worked on over the years, generally in support of another project.  Some examples below.</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li><p><a href="../code/tattletale"><b>Project Tattletale</b></a> - my ideas on creating a better, more secure web login system.  Or as I put it, "Project Tattletale aims to allow for secure transactions of username and passwords for authentication, as well as verifying the user against browser revealed system information. All of this without the user needing to do or install anything additional."<img src="../images/carl.jpg" class="right" alt="Carl"/></p></li>
		<li><p><a href="../code/carl/"><b>C.A.R.L</b></a> - C.A.R.L is korn shell script that presents a menu driven frontend for cvsnt ACL (access control lists) configuration. developed in order to update a corporate client to cvsnt while providing a sane way for non-technical personnel to configure and maintain cvs permissions.</p></li>

		<li><a href="http://hula-project.org/"><b>Hula</b></a> - I used to contribute to the mail and calendaring server that <a href="http://www.novell.com/">Novell</a> created from 20,000 lines of NetMail code that they released to open source.  The project has been dubbed Hula, and tackles things very differently compared to other LAMP based mail systems.  I've written build scripts, debugged C code, commited changes and helped with the initial creation of the <a href="../code/hula">FreeBSD Port of Hula</a>.  I spent a good deal of time trolling on #hula on irc.freenode.net, and enjoyed working with other volunteers, as well as the great Novell employees that have been the genesis of Hula.</li>
		
		<li><a href="http://getmoz.mozdev.org/"><b>getmoz</b></a> - back during the early development of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> (it was around M30 if anyone remembers that milestone) I started writing some automated build scripts to download, build and install the latest nightly of Mozilla.  In those days it would be broken every few days, so being able to test that ahead of time was pretty cool, not to mention the new (often broken) toys that would be checked in overnight to discover.  After an inital revision, Eric Thibeault Jolin from Montreal joined, helping with error logic, and other things that I hadn't thought of, which was really cool because things just evolved in that way that open source project do.  Once Mozilla got pretty stable (0.8.0) this project became unneeded.  It was a great time though, and I learned allot from it.</li>
</ul>

		<h2>www.</h2>
		<p>I love to tinker with websites, this one included.  While I do not consider myself a developer or designer, I'm able to utilize a variety of code to make things work.  This website was constructed with the Unix text editor <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, using code from all over.  Hit the about page to learn the specifics, and you can grab the exact code I used as a base for this site there as well.  I code to <a href="http://www.w3c.org/">open standards</a> (you should too), so this site should look fine in any browser; the W3C Validation tags can be found on the about page.</p>
