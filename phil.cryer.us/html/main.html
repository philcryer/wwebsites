		<p><img src="../images/space_invader.gif" class="right" alt="Space Invader" />Hi,
I'm Phil and you've reached my little corner of the web. Take a look
around to see what I'm all about. To get in touch with me for
professional services I provide, please refer to the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>

		<h2>background.</h2>
		<p>I
was born and raised in Saint Louis, Missouri, but then lived in Austin,
Texas for 9 years where I grew up, enjoyed seeing tons of bands and
drank beer all while being tossed around by the <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/dot-com-1">.com</a>
bubble. Once that was over I moved back to Saint Louis where I live
with my wife, two children and two dogs. I am currently employed at a
large company, the third such assignment since being back, as a Linux
adminstrator. The environment is a big change from favorite gig in
Austin where sandle clad developers and I worked on software at a 54
person company. I got to manage the code and administrate Unix and
Linux servers all while keeping the mood light.</p>

		<h2>quirks.</h2>
		<p>I
enjoy music (probably too much), art, yoga, time with my family, beer,
hot weather and fruit. I dislike close minded people, poorly coded
websites, loose fitting trousers and broken cd cases. Also, excuse me,
but I believe you have my stapler.</p>
	
		<h2>more.</h2>
		<p>For more information about me and my interests, you might be interested in my 'proper' websites.  My weblog as it were is <a href="http://fak3r.com/">fak3r.com</a> and my news/commentary site, where I discuss digitial rights and personal privacy issues, is <a href="http://lefttochance.com/">lefttochance.com</a>.  Other sites I host and run can be found on the launch page for <a href="http://cryer.us/">cryer.us</a>, which has been online since November of 2001.</p>
