<p>home<ul>Hi, you've reached my little site on the web.  After years of having pages dedicated to disparate interests thrown around here and there I've finally compiled them into one place; this modest site.</ul>
<p><p><p>about me<ul>
A little background on me, I was born and raised in Saint Louis, Missouri, but then lived in Austin, Texas for 9 years where I grew up, enjoyed seeing tons of bands and drank beer all while being constantly thrown around by the <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/dot-com-1"><b><i>.com</i></b></a> bubble.  Once that was over I moved back to Saint Louis where I live with my wife, two children and two dogs. I am currently employed at a large (fortune 500) company, the second such assignment since being back, where I manage code and adminstrate a variety of Unix server applications. It's a big change from favorite gig in Austin where I worked at a small (54 person) software company managing code, administrating Unix and Linux servers all while keeping the mood light.<p>
I enjoy music, art, yoga, time with my family, beer, hot weather and fruit.  I dislike close minded people, poorly coded websites, loose fitting trousers and broken cd cases.  Also, excuse me, but I believe you have my stapler.</ul>
<p><p><p>linkedin<ul>
I've been on LinkedIn since 2003 or so, but lately it's gotten more and more popular and I think much more useful. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/philcryer"><b><i>Click here</i></b></a> to view my full LinkedIn profile and connections.
