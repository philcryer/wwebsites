needles

long time - and the spells on the wire
completely ignored - except for the fire

blatantly waltzing through cars
with a hand on the ring and one on the fire

desparete interests often delay
medium thoughts like a hand on a play

rooftop romance heads for the gates
sometimes too soon / often too late
