		<h2>ART</h2>
		<p><img src="images/darkart.jpg" class="floatLeft" alt="darkart" />I have been painting on and off for fifteen years with shows in Saint Louis, New York City and Austin. While growing up I always had a strong art interest, but it was in college that I was exposed to different methods and was able to find what worked for me. Through drawing, painting, metal, stone and other core art classes, I learned how to conceptualize and build toward how I wanted things to turn out. In my paintings I explore texture and contrast by constant mixing of disparate paints. My current pieces feature the ubiquitous 'black squares' as some kind of strange monoliths. Keeping with tradition, I procrastinate with my current batch of paintings, just as I did in college.</p>
      		<p>I've always been inspired by works by artists such as Gehard Richter, Jackson Pollack, Mark Rothko, Jasper Jones, Max Beckman, Ellsworth Kelly and Richard Serra. Saint Louis Artists and instructors such as Nancy Rice, Steve Teczar, John Baltrushunas and the fabluous Art Grunman have all directly influenced my approach.</p>
